# Blaseball: A Timeline

## Season One

* The season passes relatively uneventfully. The Philly Pies claim their first Championship title

### Season One Election

* The first decree is passed, and the Forbidden Book is opened. This results in several changes to the lore/gameplay
    * “The Book” is added to the official site, most of which is censored, but appears to contain game rules
    * Solar Eclipse weather is introduced and is the only weather present in Season Two
    * Garages player Jaylen Hotdogfingers is incinerated, marking the first incineration in Blaseball history (and the only incineration to occur outside of a game and without umpire intervention)
    * A Hellmouth swallows the Moab Desert, and the Moab Sunbeams are renamed the Hellmouth Sunbeams
    * The Discipline Era begins
* The first blessings are passed, incurring the first player swaps between teams and the first player stat increases
    * Jessica Telephone receives the Max Out Hitter blessing, and is stolen from the Dallas Steaks by the Philly Pies as a result of the Steal Best Hitter blessing
    * PolkaDot Patterson receives the Max Out Pitcher blessing, and is stolen from the Kansas City Breath Mints by the Baltimore Crabs as a result of the Steal Best Pitcher blessing

## Season Two

* Season Two’s most notable feature is its 17 incinerations. The Philly Pies take the Championship once more (notably, this puts them one championship away from triggering an event declared in The Book: “If a team wins three championships they, and Blaseball, shall ascend.”)
* The Philly Pies claim their second championship

### Season Two Election

* Season Two boosts the number of decrees enacted per election to two, and the Fourth Strike and Peanuts decrees are put into place
    * Fourth Strike grants the four teams with the lowest standings at the end of the second season a fourth strike before a batter strikes out, these teams being the New York Millennials,  Kansas City Breath Mints, Hellmouth Sunbeams, and San Francisco Lovers. This effect lasts for the duration of Season Three
    * Peanuts introduces peanuts as a secondary form of currency. The function is initially unknown, but further text revealed in the book (as well as a tweet from the official Blaseball Commissioner Twitter account) suggests that eating one million of them will equate atonement and bring about an end to the Discipline Era. This market results later in the Peanut Fraud incidents that will plague Season Three
        * Peanuts also introduces two new weather types: Peanuts and Too Many Birds
            * During Peanuts weather, players may ingest stray peanuts (this results in a drop in stats if they’re allergic, and a “yummy reaction” that boosts stats if not. This is permanent)
            * The actual impact of Too Many Birds remains unknown until Season Seven, but the regularity of occurrence and size of the flocks (as denoted occasionally in the game tickers) increases as the season continues
            * Solar Eclipses still occur, and incinerations continue to occur during them
* Season Two's blessings are passed, but cause no new major changes of note

## Season Three

* Peanut Fraud and Blasphemy
    * Players exploiting the official site’s API/using autoclickers cheat themselves millions of peanuts/coins (the peanut market, as an intended feature,  fluctuated, sometimes allowing players to sell peanuts for coins and turn a profit). The site goes down during Day 2 of Season 3, resulting in the first non-“403 Bad Gateway” downtime (siesta) in Blaseball history. The umpires demand repentance.
    * The site returned for a short period, but is taken offline on Day 4 mid-game due to further occurrences of Fraud
    * More of The Book is revealed, stating “Splortsmanship, splortsmanship is dead.”
    * The site is made accessible again, but no games can be viewed. Instead, there is a rotating image of a peanut (later titled “The Shelled One” in reference to a comment made by an Umpire in the Discord) accompanied by text reading “BLASPHEMY.” Small, hidden text viewable only when highlighted is discovered between the image and the larger text, reading “JHFMTOJMNPSMLMDGFOSEZDTMJWHPADAACGRT” - the initials of incinerated players
    * BLASPHEMY continues, but the hidden text updates, now including a BB at the end of the string
    * The site becomes available once more, displaying the Day 4 game results, and Bennett Browning of the Seattle Garages is discovered to have been incinerated, the games interrupted by the event having continued in the background
    * Day 5 is plagued by instances of Blasphemy and a large string of incinerations, theorized to be punishment for Peanut Fraud
    * Peanuts jump to a cost of 1,000,000 coins for a “bucket of peanuts” (at a 1:1 coin:peanut ratio). The cost no longer fluctuates
* The Grand Unslam occurs during a game between the Shoe Thieves and the Tacos. A tie results  in the game running for 54 minutes before Morrow Doyle of the Shoe Thieves hits a Grand Slam. However, moments later, the point total rolls back to the 16-13 lead that the Thieves had earned earlier in the inning, prior to the points being scored. The site goes down immediately after, prompting an extended siesta
    * The Shelled One makes its second appearance during the Grand Unslam
        * HELLO / DID YOU TASTE THE INFINITE? / I AM BENEVOLENT / I AM A SNACK / I AM A LEGUME / I WAS BENEVOLENT / YOU ARE INSATIABLE / WHERE IS YOUR RESTRAINT?
* The Shelled One appears a third time this season after the semifinals of the postseason
    * SO ABOUT THE PEANUTS / THE BOOK WAS STRIKE ONE / THE FRAUD WAS STRIKE TWO / YOU WILL LEARN DISCIPLINE / PEANUTS / GET YOUR PEANUTS / WHILE YOU STILL CAN
        * After this, the price of a bucket of peanuts drops to 1,000 coins, still at a 1:1 ratio
* The Hades Tigers win their first championship
