# Blaseball: A Timeline

## Season One

* The season passes relatively uneventfully. The Philly Pies claim their first Championship title

### Season One Election

* The first decree is passed, and the Forbidden Book is opened. This results in several changes to the lore/gameplay
    * “The Book” is added to the official site, most of which is censored, but appears to contain game rules
    * Solar Eclipse weather is introduced and is the only weather present in Season Two
    * Garages player Jaylen Hotdogfingers is incinerated, marking the first incineration in Blaseball history (and the only incineration to occur outside of a game and without umpire intervention)
    * A Hellmouth swallows the Moab Desert, and the Moab Sunbeams are renamed the Hellmouth Sunbeams
    * The Discipline Era begins
* The first blessings are passed, incurring the first player swaps between teams and the first player stat increases
    * Jessica Telephone receives the Max Out Hitter blessing, and is stolen from the Dallas Steaks by the Philly Pies as a result of the Steal Best Hitter blessing
    * PolkaDot Patterson receives the Max Out Pitcher blessing, and is stolen from the Kansas City Breath Mints by the Baltimore Crabs as a result of the Steal Best Pitcher blessing

## Season Two

* Season Two’s most notable feature is its 17 incinerations. The Philly Pies take the Championship once more (notably, this puts them one championship away from triggering an event declared in The Book: “If a team wins three championships they, and Blaseball, shall ascend.”)
* The Philly Pies claim their second championship

### Season Two Election

* Season Two boosts the number of decrees enacted per election to two, and the Fourth Strike and Peanuts decrees are put into place
    * Fourth Strike grants the four teams with the lowest standings at the end of the second season a fourth strike before a batter strikes out, these teams being the New York Millennials,  Kansas City Breath Mints, Hellmouth Sunbeams, and San Francisco Lovers. This effect lasts for the duration of Season Three
    * Peanuts introduces peanuts as a secondary form of currency. The function is initially unknown, but further text revealed in the book (as well as a tweet from the official Blaseball Commissioner Twitter account) suggests that eating one million of them will equate atonement and bring about an end to the Discipline Era. This market results later in the Peanut Fraud incidents that will plague Season Three
        * Peanuts also introduces two new weather types: Peanuts and Too Many Birds
