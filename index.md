# Blaseball: A Timeline

## Season One

* The season passes relatively uneventfully. The Philly Pies claim their first Championship title

### Season One Election

* The first decree is passed, and the Forbidden Book is opened. This results in several changes to the lore/gameplay
    * “The Book” is added to the official site, most of which is censored, but appears to contain game rules
    * Solar Eclipse weather is introduced and is the only weather present in Season Two
    * Garages player Jaylen Hotdogfingers is incinerated, marking the first incineration in Blaseball history (and the only incineration to occur outside of a game and without umpire intervention)
    * A Hellmouth swallows the Moab Desert, and the Moab Sunbeams are renamed the Hellmouth Sunbeams
    * The Discipline Era begins
* The first blessings are passed, incurring the first player swaps between teams and the first player stat increases
    * Jessica Telephone receives the Max Out Hitter blessing, and is stolen from the Dallas Steaks by the Philly Pies as a result of the Steal Best Hitter blessing
    * PolkaDot Patterson receives the Max Out Pitcher blessing, and is stolen from the Kansas City Breath Mints by the Baltimore Crabs as a result of the Steal Best Pitcher blessing

## Season Two

* Season Two’s most notable feature is its 17 incinerations. The Philly Pies take the Championship once more (notably, this puts them one championship away from triggering an event declared in The Book: “If a team wins three championships they, and Blaseball, shall ascend.”)
* The Philly Pies claim their second championship

### Season Two Election

* Season Two boosts the number of decrees enacted per election to two, and the Fourth Strike and Peanuts decrees are put into place
    * Fourth Strike grants the four teams with the lowest standings at the end of the second season a fourth strike before a batter strikes out, these teams being the New York Millennials,  Kansas City Breath Mints, Hellmouth Sunbeams, and San Francisco Lovers. This effect lasts for the duration of Season Three
    * Peanuts introduces peanuts as a secondary form of currency. The function is initially unknown, but further text revealed in the book (as well as a tweet from the official Blaseball Commissioner Twitter account) suggests that eating one million of them will equate atonement and bring about an end to the Discipline Era. This market results later in the Peanut Fraud incidents that will plague Season Three
        * Peanuts also introduces two new weather types: Peanuts and Too Many Birds
            * During Peanuts weather, players may ingest stray peanuts (this results in a drop in stats if they’re allergic, and a “yummy reaction” that boosts stats if not. This is permanent)
            * The actual impact of Too Many Birds remains unknown until Season Seven, but the regularity of occurrence and size of the flocks (as denoted occasionally in the game tickers) increases as the season continues
            * Solar Eclipses still occur, and incinerations continue to occur during them
* Season Two's blessings are passed, but cause no new major changes of note

## Season Three

* Peanut Fraud and Blasphemy
    * Players exploiting the official site’s API/using autoclickers cheat themselves millions of peanuts/coins (the peanut market, as an intended feature,  fluctuated, sometimes allowing players to sell peanuts for coins and turn a profit). The site goes down during Day 2 of Season 3, resulting in the first non-“403 Bad Gateway” downtime (siesta) in Blaseball history. The umpires demand repentance.
    * The site returned for a short period, but is taken offline on Day 4 mid-game due to further occurrences of Fraud
    * More of The Book is revealed, stating “Splortsmanship, splortsmanship is dead.”
    * The site is made accessible again, but no games can be viewed. Instead, there is a rotating image of a peanut (later titled “The Shelled One” in reference to a comment made by an Umpire in the Discord) accompanied by text reading “BLASPHEMY.” Small, hidden text viewable only when highlighted is discovered between the image and the larger text, reading “JHFMTOJMNPSMLMDGFOSEZDTMJWHPADAACGRT” - the initials of incinerated players
    * BLASPHEMY continues, but the hidden text updates, now including a BB at the end of the string
    * The site becomes available once more, displaying the Day 4 game results, and Bennett Browning of the Seattle Garages is discovered to have been incinerated, the games interrupted by the event having continued in the background
    * Day 5 is plagued by instances of Blasphemy and a large string of incinerations, theorized to be punishment for Peanut Fraud
    * Peanuts jump to a cost of 1,000,000 coins for a “bucket of peanuts” (at a 1:1 coin:peanut ratio). The cost no longer fluctuates
* The Grand Unslam occurs during a game between the Shoe Thieves and the Tacos. A tie results  in the game running for 54 minutes before Morrow Doyle of the Shoe Thieves hits a Grand Slam. However, moments later, the point total rolls back to the 16-13 lead that the Thieves had earned earlier in the inning, prior to the points being scored. The site goes down immediately after, prompting an extended siesta
    * The Shelled One makes its second appearance during the Grand Unslam
        * HELLO / DID YOU TASTE THE INFINITE? / I AM BENEVOLENT / I AM A SNACK / I AM A LEGUME / I WAS BENEVOLENT / YOU ARE INSATIABLE / WHERE IS YOUR RESTRAINT?
* The Shelled One appears a third time this season after the semifinals of the postseason
    * SO ABOUT THE PEANUTS / THE BOOK WAS STRIKE ONE / THE FRAUD WAS STRIKE TWO / YOU WILL LEARN DISCIPLINE / PEANUTS / GET YOUR PEANUTS / WHILE YOU STILL CAN
        * After this, the price of a bucket of peanuts drops to 1,000 coins, still at a 1:1 ratio
* The Hades Tigers win their first championship

### Season Three Election

* Two decrees pass: Interviews and Eat the Rich
    * “Interviews” reveals some stats about each player, as well as their Current Vibe (which fluctuates between games, and seems to have some bearing on player performance) and some theoretically benign information such as coffee preference and pregame ritual. This information is found on player pages
        * Spacetime tears over Los Angeles. The LA Tacos become the Unlimited Tacos, and all of their players are renamed Wyatt Mason
        * The Grand Unslam is cited in flavour text as having “weakened the bridge”
        * Flavour text also includes the phrase “The Microphone lifts”
        * Feedback weather is introduced as a new weather type, during which players will occasionally switch teams with a player from the team they’re opposing
    * “Eat the Rich” redistributes wealth from the top 1% of players to the other 99%, betting that 99% 193 coins each. Flavour text implies that it may happen again. (It does)
* Many blessings that involve player theft/banishment pass, the most notable of which see Hawaii Fridays player Nagomi McDaniels stolen by the Jazz Hands before being immediately stolen once more by the Crabs

## Siesta

* The Blaseball site enters a siesta lasting two weeks in order to perform maintenance and site stabilization
* Wyatt Masons begin reverting back to their previous names, leading some to theorize that the “Wyatt Masoning” was a site error. As of Season Eight, this event has either been revealed to have been intentional or simply incorporated into the lore nonetheless

## Season Four

* The Shelled One returns shortly before Season Four begins
    * ARE YOU RESTED? / ARE YOU READY? / I HAVE HEARD YOU / TIME TO LISTEN
* Further text is revealed in the Book, and the Book also receives its second ever edit (the first being the change from “splortsmanship, splortsmanship is dead” after its abuse in the discord server during season two to “splortsmanship, splortsmanship is back”), and the text indicating that if we as fans displease the Blaseball gods, we must atone by eating one million peanuts, is crossed out and the text “STRIKE TWO” is added
* The “Waveback Event” occurs on Friday of this season, caused by an onslaught of user login issues that results in the servers being rolled back several Blaseball days. Notably, this also rolls back the incineration of Hawaii Fridays hitter Thomas England. England was replaced by Sixpack Dogwalker. After the rollback, Sixpack is still the name on the Fridays’ roster, but their stats are those of England, and they carry the item “Bangers and Smash”
* On Day 108, in the fourth of five semifinal matches between the Millenials and the Firefighters, Thomas Dracaena of the Millenials hits a ground out to Edric Tosser of the Firefighters and play stops for over twenty minutes. The game ticker reads only the ground out notification
* The Hades Tigers claim their second Championship title

### Season Four Election

* Before election results are revealed, The Shelled One makes an appearance
    * IT IS TOO LOUD / QUIET / QUIET THEM / YOU LOOKED TOO CLOSE / WHERE IS YOUR FAITH
        * “It is too loud” may have been a commentary on the immense volume of user traffic that hit the site as fans refreshed the elections page, causing the site to fail to even load for many users due to server strain
* Two decrees pass: Targeted Shame and Alternate Reality
    * Targeted Shame affects the Hades Tigers, Chicago Firefighters, New York Millenials, and Breckinridge Jazz Hands. This causes any game that they are shamed during to carry the runs scored against them during the shame period over to their next game as negative runs. This effect lasts for the duration of Season Five
    * Alternate Reality swaps two players on each team (one pitcher, one hitter) with alternate versions of themselves with rerolled stats. These players gain the Alternate Reality modifier

## Season Five

* A new weather type is introduced: Reverb. It has a chance to do one of four things: shuffle an entire roster (which can result in pitchers becoming hitters and vice versa), shuffling batting lineups, shuffling pitching rotations, or causing a single player to reverberate and have a small chance to be up for two at bats in a row
* Chicago Firefighters claim their first championship title 

### Season Five Election

* The High Filter decree is passed, resulting in leagues/divisions changing and teams being shuffled, as well as the Blood Bath being instated and occurring once per season (NOTE: as of the passing of the Enhanced Party Time decree in Season Six, devs have confirmed that the Blood Bath will not occur as originally intended, if at all. As of writing this note, it has never occurred. The Commissioner explained via Twitter that this was due to "contractor issues." Despite its non-implementation, the modifiers are recorded here as originally worded for posterity)
    * The new leagues are Wild and Mild, and the new divisions are High and Low (e.g.: the Canada Moist Talkers fall into the Mild High division)
    * The Blood Bath has different effects on each division, with each team gaining a permanent modifier
        * Wild High: Blood Pity: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams must each give Stars to the team that finished last in their division
        * Wild Low: Blood Winner: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams must each give Stars to the team that finished first in their division
        * Mild High: Blood Donor: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams will each donate Stars to an opponent that finished behind them in the standings
        * Mild Low: Blood Thief: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams will each steal Stars from an opponent who finished ahead of them in the standings
* The Idol system is introduced
    * Players are chosen as idols by fans, and the 20 most idolized players are added to a leaderboard. The top three are separated by a dotted red line. Idols can be changed for 200 coins
        * Peanut Theory: Due to the messages relayed via The Shelled One prior to the release of election results the last two seasons, this theory states that fans can atone for displeasing the Blaseball gods by getting the three players whose names were changed from Dan/Daniel to “Peanut” (Peanut Bong, Peanutiel Duffy, and Peanut Holloway) to the top three idol slots. This is at least partially confirmed as of Season Seven
    * Idols can earn their fans coins with the purchase of pendants that grant bonuses based on hits/home runs scored by batters, or shutouts/strikes thrown by pitchers. These pendants can stack, and can be upgraded in the shop
