# Blaseball: A Timeline

## Season One

* The season passes relatively uneventfully. The Philly Pies claim their first Championship title

### Season One Election

* The first decree is passed, and the Forbidden Book is opened. This results in several changes to the lore/gameplay
    * “The Book” is added to the official site, most of which is censored, but appears to contain game rules
    * Solar Eclipse weather is introduced and is the only weather present in Season Two
    * Garages player Jaylen Hotdogfingers is incinerated, marking the first incineration in Blaseball history (and the only incineration to occur outside of a game and without umpire intervention)
    * A Hellmouth swallows the Moab Desert, and the Moab Sunbeams are renamed the Hellmouth Sunbeams
    * The Discipline Era begins
* The first blessings are passed, incurring the first player swaps between teams and the first player stat increases
    * Jessica Telephone receives the Max Out Hitter blessing, and is stolen from the Dallas Steaks by the Philly Pies as a result of the Steal Best Hitter blessing
    * PolkaDot Patterson receives the Max Out Pitcher blessing, and is stolen from the Kansas City Breath Mints by the Baltimore Crabs as a result of the Steal Best Pitcher blessing
